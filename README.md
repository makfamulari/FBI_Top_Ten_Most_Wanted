# FBI Top Ten Most Wanted

The Federal Bureau of Investigation introduced its now infamous Top Ten Most Wanted List on March 14th, 1950. The list was first designed to bring publicity to the most dangeous fugitives that otherwise did not merit media attention. Of the 523 fugitives that have been placed on the list, 488 have been apprehended or located.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to investigate the members of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted list from the year it was created (1950) to present day (2020). Specifically, we aim to discover the types of criminals that merit placement based upon biographical information and the nature of their crimes. The list's members beginning in the year 1950 and to the year 2020 will be studied.

# Data

There are no current existing databases aggregating information on members of the FBI's Most Wanted List. Data scrubbing was conducted by myself using information from the FBI's archived most wanted lists. These lists contained information on dates of placement, dates of removal, and biographical information such as race, gender, and nationality. For a significant number of past criminals, the nature of crimes/profiles were not available through the FBI. To determine the reasons for placement (including suspected charges and convicted charges, if apprehended), archived court files were utilized.
