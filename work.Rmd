### Data Set-up To Experiment with Columns
```{r data_to_shiny, echo = FALSE}

# Adding in mutates and manipulating a column for days.

FBI1 <- FBI %>% 
  mutate(date_added = as.Date(date_added, format="%m/%d/%Y")) %>% 
  mutate(date_removed = as.Date(date_removed, format="%m/%d/%Y")) %>% 
  mutate(days = (date_removed - date_added)) %>% 
  mutate(days = as.numeric(days))

# This is used in the linear regression models on tab "Special Cases"

head(FBI1)

```

### Running a Sample Linear Regression with Error Bars
```{r lm, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Mutate as factor to prevent numeric consideration to 
# alter responses.

Edit <- FBI1 %>% 
  mutate(police_victim = as.factor(police_victim))

# Perform linear regression and tidy data with 
# select for relevant terms.

lm <- lm(days ~ police_victim, data = Edit) %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, std.error) 

# Plot lm with x as term and y as estimate.

ggplot(lm, aes(x = term, y = estimate)) +
  
  # Add in a geom_error bar with width modification
  # for clarity.
  
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = estimate-std.error, ymax = estimate+std.error), width = 0.1) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  
  # Repair x axis for clarity.
  
  scale_x_discrete(
    breaks = c("(Intercept)", "police_victim1"),

  ) +
